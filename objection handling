What is objection handling?
Objection handling is a part of the sales process when the prospect raises one or more objections or concerns about the product, the price, or some aspect of the sale, and you must respond to those objections to overcome them and close the sale. 

Sometimes the objections are based on misunderstanding or lack of understanding about details of the product, its promotion, its competitors, or its customers, and you can educate them about those facts. 

Sometimes the objections are really a:

Starting point for negotiating price or delivery terms or promotion incentives, and you can negotiate on those terms.
Cover for the prospect feeling overwhelmed, understaffed, or out of time, and you can consider where you can bring resources to bear to help that prospect with those feelings.
This is the time to be innovative, creative and be seen by the prospect as a collaborative partner in their success. Responding to objections is your time to shine!
