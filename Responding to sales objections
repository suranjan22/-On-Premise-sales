Responding to sales objections
Over many decades of experience in “direct” selling, some key practices and techniques have been identified to overcome objections.

They include:

Use active listening skills (Confirm). Slow down, ask open-ended questions, and try to really understand what they mean. You want to understand more than just the words they are saying. You want to understand the intent and emotion behind the words too.
Clarify with questions. Explore the issues and topics raised, and be curious. That helps the prospect feel heard, and including them in the solution development process also helps them feel ownership of the solution.
Repeat back what you heard (Catch). Make sure the other person understands that you heard them and that you understand their objection.
Validate the prospect’s concerns. As you repeat back what you heard, validate their perspective. Their emotions and intent are real, even if the facts they raise are not, or are not as important as they think they are.
Ask permission to overcome the problem. Actively seek to bring down barriers to solving the concern and gain buy-in to doing so.
Reframe their objections (Contain). Restate their concern in ways that make it more actionable, more solvable, or more in perspective and in context with other information that make it seem less daunting.
Leverage social proof (Commit). As you respond to their objections, provide stories or data about other customers who face the same issue and what worked for them.
Close the deal (Convince). Negotiate the specifics of the solution that overcomes their objections and meets their needs.
You will use these best practices to respond to an objection shortly.
